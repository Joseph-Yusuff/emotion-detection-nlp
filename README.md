# Emotion Detection from Text using NLP

## 📘 Project Overview
A Natural Language Processing project for detecting emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear) from text using traditional ML and deep learning models (MNB, SVM, BiLSTM, BERT). 

## Objectives
- Build a robust emotion classifier using publicly available datasets.
- Compare traditional ML and deep learning approaches.
- Evaluate models with F1, accuracy, AUC, and visualize performance.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
- `data/`: Information on dataset sources.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for model training and analysis.
- `models/`: Trained model files.
- `reports/`: Final project report and visualizations.

## Models Used
- **Traditional ML**: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Deep Learning**: Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Fine-tuned BERT

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Macro F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC AUC
